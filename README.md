# Gods Eye Website

## Purpose:
This page allowed Discord users to customize their server-specific settings and premium plan. 

This made configuring the bot to their needs easier by giving them a visual UI.

## Why is it no longer maintained?
This was the first project I ever worked on, and it was where I began learning to code.
If I were to improve the code, I would almost have to refactor the entire codebase.
And I just don't have the time to continue working on this, as I have worked on it for years throughout high school.
